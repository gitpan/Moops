0.007	2013-08-18

 - (Bugfix) Fix parsing for the `namespace` keyword that was broken in
   0.005.
 - (Change) Help Class::Load (and thus Moose) notice that empty roles are
   loaded by setting $VERSION to an empty string when no version is
   specified.
 - (Packaging) Dependency - runtime suggestion for MooX::HandlesVia.
 - (Packaging) More test suite improvements; still more to do.

0.006	2013-08-16

 - (Change) Call __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable on Moose/Mouse classes.
 - (Change) Rename MooX::Aspartame -> Moops.
 - (Documentation) Much improved documentation.
 - (Packaging) Some test suite improvements; more to come.

0.005	2013-08-14

 - (Change) Improvements handling comments when parsing.
 - (Change) Massive amounts of refactoring to simplify maintenance and make
   subclassing easier.
 - (Regression) Broke `namespace` keyword.

0.004	2013-08-14

 - (Addition) Implement `before`, `after` and `around` method modifiers.
 - (Addition) Implement `define` keyword to declare constants.
 - (Change) The `method` keyword is only available in classes and roles;
   not plain namespaces.
 - (Removal) Drop the `classmethod` keyword; it's better to use `method`
   and give the invocant an explicit variable name.
 - (Removal) Drop the `exporter` keyword; it is better to explicitly create
   a class extending Exporter::TypeTiny or Exporter.

0.003	2013-08-13

 - (Addition) New keyword `namespace`.
 - (Change) Don't export Try::Tiny to the outer scope, as it's not lexical.
 - (Change) Misc internal refactoring.
 - (Change) Re-implement relative package names, in a new, saner way.
 - (Packaging) use Dist::Inkt.
 - (Update) use Function::Parameters 1.0201, because it has configurable
   type constraint reification.

0.002	2013-07-17

 - (Addition) use MooX::late 0.014.
 - (Change) Misc internal refactoring.
 - (Update) use Moo 1.003000.
