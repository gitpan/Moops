   <https://github.com/tobyink/p5-moops/pull/1>

 [ Packaging ]
 - Require at least version 0.027 of Kavorka; this resolves a conflict
   using Moops with MooX::Options.

 [ Other ]
 - Hard-code a list of warnings categories to fatalize; this means that
   warnings categories added to future versions of Perl will not magically
   become fatal in Moops.

 - Fix availability of Lexical::Accessor within class {} blocks.

   option) rather than an arrayref of modules to import.

   META.json.

 [ Other ]
 - Improve Moops' extensibility via parser traits.

 - Fix a reference to Moops::DefineKeyword which will only work if you
   happen to have installed Moops over the top of a pre-0.012 version of
   Moops.

 [ Bug Fixes ]
 - Fix custom imports feature.
 - Found a remaining hard-coded list of keywords that was breaking
   extensibility mechanism.

   `true` and `false` to be correcting swept by namespace::sweep.

 [ Documentation ]

 [ Packaging ]
 - Add Mouse and Moose as 'runtime suggests' dependencies.
 - Add Perl 5.14 as an explicit dependency.

 [ Other ]
 - Improvements handling comments when parsing.
 - Massive amounts of refactoring to simplify maintenance and make
   subclassing easier.

0.004	2013-08-14

 - Added: Implement `before`, `after` and `around` method modifiers.
 - Added: Implement `define` keyword to declare constants.
 - Removed: Drop the `classmethod` keyword; it's better to use `method` and
   give the invocant an explicit variable name.
 - Removed: Drop the `exporter` keyword; it is better to explicitly create
   a class extending Exporter::TypeTiny or Exporter.
 - The `method` keyword is only available in classes and roles; not plain
   namespaces.

0.003	2013-08-13

 [ Packaging ]
 - use Dist::Inkt.

 [ Other ]
 - Added: New keyword `namespace`.
 - Don't export Try::Tiny to the outer scope, as it's not lexical.
 - Misc internal refactoring.
 - Re-implement relative package names, in a new, saner way.
 - Updated: use Function::Parameters 1.0201, because it has configurable
   type constraint reification.

0.002	2013-07-17

 - Added: use MooX::late 0.014.
 - Misc internal refactoring.
 - Updated: use Moo 1.003000.
