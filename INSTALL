    Installing Moops should be straightforward.

INSTALLATION WITH CPANMINUS
    If you have cpanm, you only need one line:

            % cpanm Moops

    If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to pass
    the "-S" flag to cpanm, which uses sudo to install the module:

            % cpanm -S Moops

INSTALLATION WITH THE CPAN SHELL
    Alternatively, if your CPAN shell is set up, you should just be able to
    do:

            % cpan Moops

MANUAL INSTALLATION
    As a last resort, you can manually install it. Download the tarball and
    unpack it.

    Consult the file META.json for a list of pre-requisites. Install these
    first.

    To build Moops:

            % perl Makefile.PL
            % make && make test

    Then install it:

            % make install

    If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to run:

            % sudo make install

OPTIONAL FEATURES
    Moops provides several optional features, which may require additional
    pre-requisites. These features are:

    *   Moo (allow classes and roles to be built with Moo)

    *   Moose (allow classes and roles to be built with Moose)

    *   Mouse (allow classes and roles to be built with Mouse)

    *   Tiny (allow classes and roles to be built with Class::Tiny/Role::Tiny)

    cpanminus 1.7000 and above support installing optional features:

            % cpanm --with-feature=Moo Moops

    Otherwise, Makefile.PL can prompt you to select features. Set the
    `MM_INSTALL_FEATURES` environment variable to "1" before running
    Makefile.PL.
